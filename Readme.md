# snakeAI

Inspired by: https://github.com/BrianHaidet/AlphaPhoenix/tree/master/Snake_AI_(2020a)_DHCR_with_strategy  
and by: https://github.com/twanvl/snake

## Goal
Implement new algorithms in Python using CUDA to (hopefully) deliver faster average Snake game completion times than in the source video.

## Constraints
1. Grid size of 30x30
2. Performance metric is number of "steps" to finish the game, averaged over 100 runs

## Requirements
* Anaconda distro of Python (numpy, tkinter, pandas)

## Usage
* Run ` python controller.py` from within the src directory  
* `-h` for help / arguments
